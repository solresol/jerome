Software to automate biblical translation

Most computerised translation projects have a known source and target language. The resulting program will take fresh text in the source language and translate it into the target language. The challenge is dealing with every edge case, and inferring meaning in the source text.

Biblical translation isn't quite like that. The source text that you want to translate is known very well. Large sections have been heavily annotated for grammar, subject-predicate pairs and so on -- and the bits that haven't been, can be. The challenge is that usually, you are translating into a language where you don't have a full grammar, or where it's similar to another language group.

**Stage 1**

(What is still being developed.)

- Some larger fully-annotated texts (e.g. the whole sermon on the mount, for example)
- Generated English output from those annotated texts to confirm the validity of the approach.


**Stage 2**

- Add further output translation languages (still hard-coded)


**Stage 3**

- Develop some sort of generic grammar and vocabulary definition language (there's a PhD or two in that).


**Stage 4**

- Attempt to derive grammar and vocabulary from existing partial translations.
